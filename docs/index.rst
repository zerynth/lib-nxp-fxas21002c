**************

The FXAS21002C is a small, low-power, yaw, pitch, and roll angular rate gyroscope with 16 bit ADC resolution. The full-scale range is adjustable from ±250°/s to ±2000°/s. It features the I2C interfaces.

FXAS21002C is capable of measuring angular rates up to ±2000°/s, with output data rates (ODR) from 12.5 to 800 Hz. An integrated Low-Pass Filter (LPF) allows the host application to limit the digital signal bandwidth. The device may be configured to generate an interrupt when a user-programmable angular rate threshold is crossed on any one of the enabled axes.
